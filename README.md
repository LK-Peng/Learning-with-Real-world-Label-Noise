## Paper: Human-Annotated Label Noise and Their Impact on ConvNets for Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification

* We obtained human annotations for the UC Merced dataset from 32 independent labelers. 
* Please find these human annotations with real-world label noise in the file ['human_annotations.xlsx'](https://github.com/LK-Peng/Learning-with-Real-world-Label-Noise/blob/main/human_annotations.xlsx)

    * The first column stores the image names. These image names are the same as those in the [UCMerced dataset](http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html).
    * The remaining columns indicate human annotations from 32 independent labelers. Each column corresponds to human annotations from a single labeler, with the labeler index indicated in the first row as 'S*' (e.g., S01 and S02).

* Here is [the paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10757363).
